Timer Object
The Timer is a subclass of Thread. Timer class represents an action that should be run only after a certain amount of
time has passed. A Timer starts its work after a delay, and can be canceled at any point within that delay time period.

Timers are started, as with threads, by calling their start() method. The timer can be stopped
(before its action has begun) by calling the cancel() method. The interval the timer will wait before executing its
action may not be exactly the same as the interval specified by the user.

class threading.Timer(interval, function, args=None, kwargs=None)
